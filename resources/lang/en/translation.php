                                <p>If you’re new to raffle, or even gambling in general, you may not only be wondering how it works, but also if it’s fair. That’s why, to help put your mind at ease, we’ve answered some of the questions you may have on fair raffles.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Is the raffle safe? How do I know is not fake?</h3><br>
                                <p>All the results of the raffle are generated randomly and broadcasted online - cannot be predetermined. We use a number generator standard in industry for choosing the winner of every contest.</p><br>
                                <h3>Is online tombola different to land based tombola?</h3><br>
                                <p>There are many similarities between the online raffle and the physical raffle. Each player chooses a competition of interest, buys one or more tickets, and after the draw sees if the winning numbers match those on their tickets. If they match, they get the prize, if not they are invited to try their luck again.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>How does tombola work? Is online tombola fixed?</h3><br>
