                        <p>Your personal data may be processed by us and/or our business partners, suppliers,
                            sub-processing certain services on our behalf for the purposes specified above. For
                            example, we share information with security verification companies, for the purpose
                            of card/payment processing, identity and security checking (the Customer's credit
                            rating will be unaffected) or investigations on Tombola's behalf.</p><br>
                        <p>Such third parties have access to personal data solely for the purposes of
                            performing the services specified in the applicable engagement, or to comply with
                            applicable laws and not for any other purpose.</p><br>
                        <p>We will have in place an agreement with our service providers which will restrict
                            how they are able to process your personal information and require them to keep it
                            secure.</p><br>
                        <p>We may also use service providers in less direct ways, such as in the provision of
                            our payment and finance systems, fraud verification. We may exchange information
                            with other companies and organisations for the purposes of age verification, data
                            cleansing, fraud protection, credit checks and/or risk reduction.</p><br>
                        <p>If you have been found to have defrauded or cheated the company or any service
                            including game manipulation or payment fraud, including stolen credit cards, or
                            fraudulent activity (including chargeback or other reversal of a payment) or money
                            laundering, we reserve the right to share this information, including your identity

                            method approved as privacy-safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe:</p><br>

                            <li>â€¢ the recipient of the personal information is legally bound to protect your

                        <p>If any service provider is based outside of the European Economic Area, we will
                            ensure that the provider is either a current subscriber to the EU/US Privacy Shield,
                            or we have an appropriate contract for the international transfer of personal
                            information with them.</p><br>
                        <p>We may share any of your personal data with a prospective purchaser or purchaser of

                            of our purchaser, so that they can appropriately value the business and assess any
                            risks and continue doing business with you after the acquisition.
                            In addition we may be required by law or by a court to disclose certain information
                            about you or any engagement we may have with you to relevant regulatory, law

                            is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations. This
                            may mean that we keep some types of personal data for longer than others.</p><br>
                        <p>We will only retain your personal data for a limited period of time. This will
                            depend on a number of factors, including:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>â€¢ any laws or regulations that we are required to follow, especially regulatory

                        </ul><br>

                        <p>Any personal data contained in any work related correspondence or records may be
                            retained for longer, dependant on the retention period of the file that your
                            personal data is held on.</p><br>
